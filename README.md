# Plus1 Labs Intern Day Part 1

### Hello World!

1. Set up a github repository for your project.
2. Satisfy the following requirements:
* The user should navigate to your application's URL and see a page displaying "Hello World!".
* The user should see the current time and date underneath the "Hello World" display.
* The current time and date should be fetched from a web service of your own creation exposing an endpoint that provides the time and date at the time of the request.
3. Deploy your application to Heroku. (Consider creating your project and then deploying your fresh, empty project to Heroku, just to get Heroku running and ready to receive your application once you complete Step 2.)

When you have satisifed these requirements, let us know! Throughout these challenges, keep in mind that **function** is far more important than form. Something that works is better than something that is aesthetically pleasing, at least in the context of the Intern Day challenges.
